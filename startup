#! IMPORTANT

- TABLES MESSAGES and CHATS have circular referencing so they cant be migrated as they are.
- To migrate them first comment out the references of MESSAGES in CHATS
    and also comment out the occurences in the CONTROLLERS.
- Then migrate the TABLES, uncomment the references and migrate again.
- Do the same for GROUP_MESSAGES and GROUP_CHATS
